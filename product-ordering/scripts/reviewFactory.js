She said she would never taste a waffle as fine as the waffles her long lost lover once made her. That was until I bought one of these waffle irons! Smaug has done it again, he never disapoints!"

Only leaving 4.7 out of 5 because I requested smaug custom engrave my waffle iron with his signiture and he said no. I get it he is a busy guy but I buy all of his waffle irons you think he would go out of his way to show his customers some love. I don't want to be that guy though, awesome job smaug, and thanks again."
